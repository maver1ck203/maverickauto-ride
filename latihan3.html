<p><blockquote>Yamaha's R-Series of motorcycles today is led by the flagship YZF-R1 superbike, with the lineup including the YZF-R6, R7,R3, R25, R15, and R125. Every sportbike comprising the R-Series family is designed to offer riding excitement to motorcyclists across the globe. 
    The Yamaha YZF-R series, also known as the "R-series," is Yamaha's iconic line of sport motorcycles that began with the YZF-R1 in 1998. It was designed to offer track-level performance with everyday usability, pushing the boundaries of technology and engineering. The R1 introduced innovations like a lightweight chassis and advanced electronics, influencing the entire industry. Following its success, Yamaha expanded the lineup to include models like the YZF-R6 (1999) for middleweight supersport riders, and the YZF-R3 (2015) for beginners and smaller displacement markets. Each model shares the DNA of performance, precision, and a focus on rider experience, making the YZF-R series a mainstay in competitive racing and popular among sportbike enthusiasts worldwide.</p></blockquote>

            <a href="https://img.incar.tw/2019/09/1568285660-2e399dc3b19423ad80d8c40ac7c25775.jpg" target="_blank">

            <p style="text-align: justify;">The Yamaha YZF-R15 is a single-cylinder sport bike made by Yamaha Motor Company in 2008. In September 2011, the second iteration, called v2.0, was released in India, and in April 2014 it was released in Indonesia. 
                In January 2017, the bike's third iteration, v3.0, was launched in Indonesia. The engine for the first and second iteration (v2.0) was a 149.5 cc single cylinder four-stroke engine with four valves and a single overhead camshaft. 
                The bore and stroke were 57.0 mm x 58.7 mm (2.24 in x 2.31 in). This engine had a claimed 12.2 kW (16.4 hp) of power at 8,500 rpm and 14.5 N⋅m (10.7 lbf⋅ft) of torque at 7,500 rpm. The radiator is placed in the front of the engine with a fan behind it. 
                The coolant reserve is on the left side up and behind the radiator. The transmission is a return type six-speed with a constant mesh wet multi-plate clutch. For the first and second iteration, the bike had a 270 mm (11 in) 
                single disc with dual piston calipers in the front and a 220 mm single disc single piston caliper at the rear, both the brake systems being made by Nissin of Japan. The front suspension was a twin telescopic fork, and the rear is a linked type of single shock suspension. 
                The bike has dual headlights like the other bikes of the YZF-R series. </P>

                <p style="text-align: justify;"> The Yamaha YZF-R6 is a sport bike, produced by Yamaha as a 600 class from 1999 to 2020. From 2021, production availability is limited to a non-homologated race-only specification in most global markets, causing race organisers to realign their engine eligibility criteria to encourage other manufacturers having larger than 600 cc displacements to enter road-race competition from 2022. 
                    Race organisers wanted to provide scope for alternative machinery to move away from established tradition of the Yamaha R6 being the dominant marque in Supersport racingIn 2017 the R6 received improved aerodynamics with styling inspired by the 2015 R1, as well as its 43 mm inverted front fork and front brakes, new rear shock, a new aluminum fuel tank, magnesium subframe, ABS brakes, riding modes, and traction control.
                    The new aerodynamics are claimed to reduce drag by 8% over previous models. The engine is unchanged, with rear-wheel power still at about 120 hp. Body is similar to MotoGPs 2005–YZR-M1. The 2017 update comes with an OBD port. Unlike previous models, this R6 does not have the same diagnostic mode option.

                <p style="text-align: justify;"> At the centennial EICMA motorcycle show, Yamaha officially unveiled a new generation of R1,similar to the contemporary YZR M1. Yamaha claims a wet weight of 199 kg (439 lb) Engine changes include a decreased bore-to-stroke ratio, a larger airbox, a finger-follower valve system, and fracture split titanium conrods.[16] Magnesium wheels are standard, and information is presented to the rider through a user-customizable thin-film display.
                    The new bike has an electronics package that includes a sophisticated Traction Control System (TCS), a Slide Control System (SCS), an anti-wheelie Lift Control System (LIF), linked antilock brakes, a Launch Control System (LCS), a Quick Shift System (QSS), and selectable power modes. The Slide Control System on the R1 is the first on a production motorcycle.Information is fed to the bike through a six-axis inertial measurement unit and other sensors over 100 times a second. 
                    Power delivery is tapered through throttle valve manipulation and ignition and fuel cuts. A second higher-spec, limited production model called the R1M is also produced, and is differentiated from the standard model by having more expensive components, such as electronic semi-active Öhlins suspension, carbon fiber bodywork, Yamaha's Communication Control Unit (CCU), a Y-TRAC data logging system, and grippier Bridgestone tires with a larger rear 200/55 size.

            <p style="text-align: justify;"> The Yamaha YZF-R7 is a super sport motorcycle based on the MT-07 platform. On May 18, 2021 Yamaha announced the motorcycle, sharing a name with the 1999 YZF-R7 race homologation bike. The 2022 motorcycle is a mid capacity powered by a 54.7 kW (73 hp) liquid cooled four-stroke inline two cylinder double overhead cam 689cc engine. 
                    It features forged aluminum pistons with direct plated cylinders integrated with the crankcase. The R7's reliable crossplane engine's 270 degree crank provides an uneven firing sequence, which is designed to deliver a more characterful note and emphasize torquey acceleration and power delivery. 
                    The engine was updated in 2021 to be Euro 5 compliant providing peak output of 73.4 hp at 8,750 rpm and 67 Nm of torque at 6,500 rpm. The Yamaha R7 reaches a top speed of 139 miles per hour.
                    The 2022 Yamaha R7 model first came in two color options which was Team Yamaha Blue and Performance Black. Later in 2022 Yamaha offered the Yamaha R7 in a special World GP 60th anniversary edition. This motorcycle came in a white color with red and gold accents that was paying respect to Yamaha and their racing program.

            <p style="text-align: justify;"> Featuring next‑generation R‑Series styling, sophisticated electronic control, supersport braking and suspension performance and a high‑performance crossplane engine.
                    Yamaha has a rich heritage of building supersport motorcycles designed to deliver the pinnacle of performance on and off the track. Based on the legendary YZF-R1, the R1M goes a step above: standard features include premium Öhlins Electronic Racing Suspension (ERS), a standard Communication Control Unit (CCU) for data and lap time acquisition with your smartphone, MotoGP-derived electronics and carbon fibre bodywork. From crossplane crankshaft engines to revolutionary electronics such as the six-axis Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), Yamaha’s historical achievements have become the future of R World.
                    Your whole motorcycling career has been building up to this moment. And with the R1M you can be sure that you are in possession of the most advanced Yamaha production track bike of all time. Take a look at the more aerodynamic M1-inspired carbon bodywork and it’s clear that this race-focused motorcycle is constructed like no other machine.A second higher-spec, limited production model called the R1M is also produced, and is differentiated from the standard model by having more expensive components, such as electronic semi-active Öhlins suspension, carbon fiber bodywork.
                    R1M can goes faster than R1 because it have lighter body than the standard R1.</p>
